# AI-CHATBOT
AI Chatbot that will reply with human like messages based on the previous chats.
To use this you must have the paid subscription of OpenAI ( ChatGPT ).
I have mentioned the instructions in the code on how to use your API Key and where will you have to use it in the code.
This chatbot replies to the sender on behalf of you half. 
You need to select the area of the chat and click on the typing pad on your chatbox.
The bot will automatically generate the appropriate Human like reply for the chat.
Please remember the bot is designed only when the last message is from the sender. 
Make sure you have the correct co-ordinates of your particular chatting application.
If not, you can use the get_cursor.py file to get the co-ordiates and then use them in you code.
